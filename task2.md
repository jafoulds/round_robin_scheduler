### _Task 2 Description_  
For this task, I started by figuring out a way to calculate the average waiting and turnaround time for a program run with a specific dispatch cost and quantum length. This was completed by adding a function called "print_average_wait_and_ta_times" in rrsim.c that will calculate the average turnaround and wait times when executing rrsim with a given quantum length and dispatch cost. Every time a task is completed in this program, the turnaround and wait times are computed and printed to one of the previously mentioned files. These calculated values are added to global variables called total_wait_times and total_ta_times. Once all tasks are completed, total_wait_times and total_ta_times are divided by the number of events variable, "num_events" which is calculated in main. The program will then append the wait times and turnaround times to the text files python_input_wait.txt and python_input_ta.txt respectively.  
After outputting the results of the 24 runs of rrsim with quantum lengths 50, 100, 250 and 500 and dispatch costs of 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 to these two text files, you can then pass either of these files to "graph.py" to construct a graph. This python script has simple file handling and only accepts two different files called "python_input_ta.txt" and "python_input_wait.txt" which will of course hold the turnaround times and the wait times respectively.  
My "graph.py" program uses a combination of the "numpy" and "matplotlib" libraries as recommended by our teaching assistant Amanda in our lab. This program adds the computed values into the following lists: y50, y100, y250, and y500 where the integer represents the respective quantum value. These lists are then converted into numpy arrays so that matplotlib can use them. The title of the graph is then set by "plt.figure" while "plt.xlabel" and "plt.ylabel" set the labels for the x and y axes. After that, the function "plt.plot()" is used to actually create the lines on the graph. The numpy array containing either the turnaround or wait times are passed into plt.plot() as the y value, while a numpy array containing the dispatch values are passed in as the x variable. A line is then calculated and constructed using the two numpy arrays as the x and y values. The graph is then finally outputted using "plt.show()".
